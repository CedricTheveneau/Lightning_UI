# Lightning_UI
Lightning UI is a CSS library I made to simplify the styling on a cross platform project. The goal is to have a defined style everywhere that will save me both time and style consistency issues to fix.

TO use the stylesheet anywhere, just enter this link : https://cedrictheveneau.github.io/Lightning_UI/style.css into your CSS call tag in the head of your document.
