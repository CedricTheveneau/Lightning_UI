# Lightning_UI | Version : V1.0.1

[Lightning UI](https://cedrictheveneau.github.io/Lightning_UI/) is a CSS library I made to simplify the styling on a cross platform project. The goal is to have a defined style everywhere that will save me both time and style consistency issues to fix.

## Description :

Lightning UI is a simple yet eye-catching front-end library of ready to use components.
This library was built from the ground up, with an heavy focus on being highly customizable, yet solid in its conception.
Within minutes, you can give your website an impressive look, that will catch the eye of those who will see it, without struggling for hours to figure how things work. It just works.

I used beginner friendly technologies because I wanted everyone to be able to use it. You don't even need to use the command line to access it, just go on [the website](https://cedrictheveneau.github.io/Lightning_UI/) and click on "Download library", the library will be saved as a zip file with everything to start up, and you'll even be redirected towards the [quick start page](https://cedrictheveneau.github.io/Lightning_UI/pages/quickStart.html), guiding you through the startup.

It was quite the challenge for me, as it was my very first library, but I learnt a lot of things, and there are still things to learn and improve in the code. I'll be focusing on that next.

## Languages used :

This library only uses HTML, CSS and JS.

- Components are styled based on nesting, to keep a strict but robust layout. When using the components given with the library, you'll be sure to have a perfect render.
- JS is used for various dynamic elements/functionnalities, like the dark/light theme, the carousel, and other animations based on scroll.

## Flags / TO DO :

- [&#10060;] SEO optimisation
- [&#10060;] Accessibility features

## Quick start :

You don't even need to use the command line to grab a copy of Lightning UI, just go on [the website](https://cedrictheveneau.github.io/Lightning_UI/) and click on "Download library", the library will be saved as a zip file with everything to start up, and you'll even be redirected towards the [quick start page](https://cedrictheveneau.github.io/Lightning_UI/pages/quickStart.html), guiding you through the startup. As simple as that.

## Credits :

I've worked alone on this project, if you have any request, question, suggestion, feedback, feel free to contact me using the [Contact page](https://cedrictheveneau.github.io/Lightning_UI/pages/contact.html). I've written every single line of code from this project. Everything there is to know about this project is written in the [About](https://cedrictheveneau.github.io/Lightning_UI/pages/about.html) and [Legals](https://cedrictheveneau.github.io/Lightning_UI/pages/legals.html) pages. But you can always ask me directly if needed.

## License :

Lightning UI uses an [MIT License](./LICENSE.md), which means you can pretty much do anything with it, as long as you keep the original LICENSE.md and NOTICE.md files into your project which uses this library and respect the terms of use mentionned in them.

## Notice :

When using Lightning UI, you need to keep in your project both the LICENSE.md and NOTICE.md files that were given with the library. I recommend updating the NOTICE.md file when you use the library, it's a good practice to keep track of what is used in your project. For example, if you build a React app, you can add it to the NOTICDE.md file, above the "Lightning UI" section heading.
