      "<p>Yes, it's official. Yesterday, while updating the README.md file, I stated that I was doing some research regarding licensing, to find the right license to pick for this project.</p><p>After hours and hours of looking around, asking ChatGPT, exploring forums and finally finding some well written and documented articles, I decided to pick an MIT License. Easy to understand, permissive, nothing to worry about, straight forward and quick to set up; it seems to be the best suited one for this library.</p><p>I hesitated with the Apache 2.0 License, but it seemed a bit too much for a simple component library, I took my decision after looking for popular softwares that used one of those license. In the end, most libraries/frameworks use an MIT License, so I decided to go with it.</p><p>Thanks for reading this, I hope Lightning UI will be useful to you, sincerely.</p><br/><p>Cédric, creator of Lightning UI</p>",

      "<p>So, a quick recap regarding the technology behind Lightning UI as well as hints at how to customize it to your liking.</p><p>Lightning UI is built with CSS, mainly using variables to make it easier and quicker to switch up. The code is nested, for a more robust yet strict layout styling. I'll work later on making it less strict. But for now, I'd suggest using the given components only, for a quick setup without too much work.</p><p>Of course, switching things up is absolutely doable, though it might take some time, considering the code is nested and I'm the one who's written it. Don't worry, I plan on working on various other blocks with time, just not right now.</p><p>It's a work in progress that takes lots and lots of time, especially when working on it alone.</p><p>There's also some JS with the library : a file containing all the functions that make the carousel, theme selection and various other animations work. You can tweak it if you want, or even expend on it and add features you might need, feel free to do so. Same goes for the CSS file, obviously.</p><p>There's also a second file, directly added to it, with a ready to use template for blogging. It's actually the one i'm using right now to create this post. It's not the most sofisticated one, but it works, and is simple to use for people that aren't too familiar with JS. Which is one of my main focus.</p><br/><p>Now, regarding the sister app. This whole project is originally for a project of mine, made to decrease integration time, to have more time to work on actual features. - To be honest, creating a library from scratch is pretty time consumming haha</p><p>The sister app is my graduation project, named Workout Buddy, it will be a PWA, made with React, and it'll use this library. It'll be part of a website, presenting the app and everything there's to know about it. And of course, the web app will also be hosted on this website, benefiting from the library as well.</p><p>As you can imagine, there's still plenty of work waiting for me, and this library will benefit from it over time, with plenty of new app-designed components that will join the ever growing <a href='../pages/components.html'>Components</a> section.</p><p>I can't wait to present that other porject and talk about it more freely. For now, I must keep my mouth shut so I don't disappoint anyone.</p><p>As always, thanks for reading this post, sincerely.</p><br/><p>Cédric, creator of Lightning UI</p>",
